### 🏃🏽‍♂️🏃🏽‍♀️ The Short Answer

You're in a hurry aye? No dramas...

This post assumes that you have already:

- Connected to Microsoft 365 with the Powershell Module
- AND connected to Exchange Online with the Powershell Module

If you've completed these steps, then please go ahead and check out the below instructions.

**✅ Turning on Read-Only**

```ps
Set-UnifiedGroup <Display Name> -CalendarMemberReadOnly
```

<div className="alert warning">
  <strong>Please note</strong>
  <br></br>
  - That this will come back with a warning stating that the command completed
    successfully but no settings of 'Display Name' have been modified.
  <br></br>
  - This is incorrect, the value actually has changed, and you can do this by
    referring to the 'Checking the value' commmand listed in this post.
</div>

**⛔ Disabling Read-Only**

```powershell
Set-UnifiedGroup <Display Name> -CalendarMemberReadOnly:$false
```

<div className="alert warning">
  <strong>Please note</strong>
  <br></br>
  - That this will come back with a warning stating that the command completed
    successfully but no settings of 'Display Name' have been modified.
  <br></br>
  - This is incorrect, the value actually has changed, and you can do this by
    referring to the 'Checking the value' commmand listed in this post.
</div>

**🔍 Checking The Read-Only Setting**

```powershell
Get-UnifiedGroup <Display Name> -IncludeAllProperties | Select-Object -Property CalendarMemberReadOnly
```

OR

```powershell
Get-UnifiedGroup <Display Name> -IncludeAllProperties | Format-List
```

Here is an example if you want to enable the `CalendarMemberReadOnly` for a few groups at a time, this is using a hardcoded list of Display Names, however, you could easily combine the `-Filter` flag on the `Get-UnifiedGroup` module to dynamically create this list from a property.

```powershell
$groups = @("Group 1","Group 2","Group 3","Group 4")
for ($i = 0; $i -lt $groups.Count; $i++) {
    Set-UnifiedGroup $groups[$i] -CalendarMemberReadOnly
    Get-UnifiedGroup $groups[$i] -IncludeAllProperties | Select-Object -Property CalendarMemberReadOnly
}
```

### The Long Answer

Reading the Microsoft Documentation... 😭 here are the relevant links that I used for this research:

- [Set-UnifiedGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/set-unifiedgroup?view=exchange-ps)
- [Get-UnifiedGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/get-unifiedgroup?view=exchange-ps)
